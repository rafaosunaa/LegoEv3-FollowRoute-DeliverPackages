# LegoEv3-FollowRoute-DeliverPackages

Automated Package Delivery Robot Project

Our team has been assigned to program a delivery robot for a well-known logistics company using the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 platform. The goal is to develop a fully automated system to transport a package from point "a" to point "b" in the most efficient way possible. The project simulates the entire delivery process, from initial pickup to final handoff, managed by a centralized system with optimized algorithms.

The project consists of three key stages:

Pickup: The robot collects the package from the origin, using sensors and actuators to perform the task precisely.
Preparation: Optimal routes are assigned through algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), ensuring obstacles are avoided.
Delivery: The robot follows the most efficient route to deliver the package quickly and accurately.
The documentation outlines the system's programming, from sensor configuration to the integration of AI algorithms for route optimization.
